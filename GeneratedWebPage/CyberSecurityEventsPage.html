    <h1>1. Microsoft Blocks Iran-linked Lebanese Hackers Targeting Israeli Companies</h1>
    <p> <img style="border:10px solid black;" src =https://thehackernews.com/new-images/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg6QgmIugjApGsSp_v-DgmrWh7TAwmgc2-q7he3aZA3LmwS3p9FJchpB4duBUG7J8wctZHQGDUg2jvObX6Lto5BZUAMDX2xH7JG8EDRyjRmSLmiaQl8rgHeOaQhlEL7oZDJgxSQOX8XlQiMQHLt36bKZAAJU2uaq2rKhruJOh9LNq60PhKcZc8Lj6Dn/s728-e1000/hackers.jpg id='test' onerror='error_loading_image()'><br><br> Microsoft on Thursday said it took steps to disable malicious activity stemming from abuse of OneDrive by a previously undocumented threat actor it tracks under the chemical element-themed moniker Polonium.  In addition to removing the offending accounts created by the Lebanon-based activity group, the tech giant&#39;s Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC) said it suspended over 20 malicious OneDrive applications created and that it notified affected organizations.  &quot;The observed activity was coordinated with other actors affiliated with Iran&#39;s Ministry of Intelligence and Security (MOIS), based primarily on victim overlap and commonality of tools and techniques,&quot; MSTIC&#160; assessed &#160;with &quot;moderate confidence.&quot;   The adversarial collective is believed to have breached more than 20 organizations based in Israel and one intergovernmental organization with operations in Lebanon since February 2022.  Targets of interest included entities in the manufacturing, IT, transpo....</p>

    <h1>2. Hackers Exploiting Unpatched Critical Atlassian Confluence Zero-Day Vulnerability</h1>
    <p> <img style="border:10px solid black;" src =https://thehackernews.com/new-images/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgtFRIbOmYLbsTQsfQcmDa8dd7UbU-isTy7dToS2Gy1p7s--Zt-QgfjUpligZQwwZouhjIgGzL8kjD1QlluSfAvuZ7I7GKPJG21wA9tfWYRmChZ7jK57W-8AeMWNQDwHO9tEJkbBfs3AltDvfY7kp3Bl13jp3djDlSN_7F0g5plbOk_BGleGYX9aFNC/s728-e1000/hackers.jpg><br><br> Atlassian has warned of a critical unpatched remote code execution vulnerability impacting Confluence Server and Data Center products that it said is being actively exploited in the wild.  The Australian software company credited cybersecurity firm Volexity for identifying the flaw, which is being tracked as&#160; CVE-2022-26134 .  &quot;Atlassian has been made aware of current active exploitation of a critical severity unauthenticated remote code execution vulnerability in Confluence Data Center and Server,&quot; it&#160; said &#160;in an advisory.  &quot;There are currently no fixed versions of Confluence Server and Data Center available. Atlassian is working with the highest priority to issue a fix.&quot; Specifics of the security flaw have been withheld until a software patch is available.   All supported versions of Confluence Server and Data Center are affected, although it&#39;s expected that all versions of the enterprise solution are potentially vulnerable. The earliest impacted version is ....</p>

    <h1>3. Threat Detection Software: A Deep Dive</h1>
    <p> <img style="border:10px solid black;" src =https://thehackernews.com/new-images/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgVkdBkFynO8V07fDpAyS13LBn34KKsez-rHn3GrjAT6skNY4yBSHFQguTpCy3zq8Kxj8dYWFgTuYF5RqK1uQQkQNzT7W_uFHByKp5KMes8uqs_JMAXFyeZV5QVIPXJyEzWLMin5Fox8FdKt1EIzMDDJH134yWih2jYeV0JMhsP-3r-DeVuSzK3oJVR/s728-e1000/panther.jpg><br><br> As the threat landscape evolves and multiplies with more advanced attacks than ever, defending against these modern cyber threats is a monumental challenge for almost any organization.&#160;  Threat detection is about an organization's ability to accurately identify threats, be it to the network, an endpoint, another asset or an application &#8211; including cloud infrastructure and assets. At scale, threat detection analyzes the entire security infrastructure to identify malicious activity that could compromise the ecosystem.  Countless solutions support threat detection, but the key is to have as much data as possible available to bolster your security visibility. If you don't know what is happening on your systems, threat detection is impossible.&#160;  Deploying the right security software is critical for protecting you from threats.  What do we mean by threat detection software?  In the early days of threat detection, software was deployed to protect against different forms of malware. However, ....</p>

    <h1>4. Conti Leaks Reveal Ransomware Gang's Interest in Firmware-based Attacks</h1>
    <p> <img style="border:10px solid black;" src =https://thehackernews.com/new-images/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgli7THfn4tfmpMP5yyBJwluOG1d0mmnZONyJYdn1EltHTSoqJoUm6ThLIUtVY5vcTfrY9DwTb3dCyV4n1TkZArKhItBuD8xYcFOMoXT16_e5nIcNzkIiHxN7yG2vi3M4mpTYg9m7F6qPdS2x0WejwfJ8Mux4ir8rtTbJSjhHUyqGzWwfO5fOhoYnwm/s728-e1000/conti-ransomware.jpg><br><br> An analysis of&#160; leaked chats &#160;from the notorious&#160; Conti ransomware group &#160;earlier this year has revealed that the syndicate has been working on a set of firmware attack techniques that could offer a path to accessing privileged code on compromised devices.  &quot;Control over firmware gives attackers virtually unmatched powers both to directly cause damage and to enable other long-term strategic goals,&quot; firmware and hardware security firm Eclypsium&#160; said &#160;in a report shared with The Hacker News.  &quot;Such level of access would allow an adversary to cause irreparable damage to a system or to establish ongoing persistence that is virtually invisible to the operating system.&quot;   Specifically, this includes attacks aimed at embedded microcontrollers such as the Intel&#160; Management Engine &#160;( ME ), a privileged component that&#39;s part of the company&#39;s processor chipsets and which can completely bypass the operating system.  It&#39;s worth noting that the reason for this evolv....</p>

    <h1>5. Researchers Demonstrate Ransomware for IoT Devices That Targets IT and OT Networks</h1>
    <p> <img style="border:10px solid black;" src =https://thehackernews.com/new-images/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgfUweFQPNzCRMaDyzc_egtJ3GnCedtHRZERH2BwT45CD4BS2cLgEXNiTz1NJHCgnmgzBMzzizdy91gSiz1a2d2SUIfsBfYuvmmcVXcytiBeUSFPJWsrBYQPROtlXel155StxZH8mvHFTiAvm7Ji4v2pg4SZiiN4G11PDqMO405sxyLSy5vxEPkSIhE/s728-e100/hacking.jpg><br><br> As ransomware infections have evolved from purely encrypting data to schemes such as double and triple extortion, a new attack vector is likely to set the stage for future campaigns.  Called Ransomware for IoT or&#160; R4IoT &#160;by Forescout, it&#39;s a &quot;novel, proof-of-concept ransomware that exploits an IoT device to gain access and move laterally in an IT [information technology] network and impact the OT [operational technology] network.&quot;  This potential pivot is based on the rapid growth in the number of IoT devices as well as the convergence of IT and OT networks in organizations.   The ultimate goal of R4IoT is to leverage exposed and vulnerable IoT devices such as IP cameras to gain an initial foothold, followed by deploying ransomware in the IT network and taking advantage of poor operational security practices to hold mission-critical processes hostage.  &quot;By compromising IoT, IT, and OT assets, R4IoT goes beyond the usual encryption and data exfiltration to cause phys....</p>

    <h1>6. ExpressVPN Removes Servers in India After Refusing to Comply with Government Order</h1>
    <p> <img style="border:10px solid black;" src =https://thehackernews.com/new-images/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgclNmJcaeIekF_TPPsnCwHc8jL4cABOD3nAmTd13WNC1kOLkpqpsFjzfiCvriUyfcleF8ZxT-EB18CJ8W1MOyHG9GDIVtNlNosgphb-COLQLV7h0PnkDjpQ4pVCbGFAezXzIXGLWgW0caHeqxq8i6YpXJpWO3sw7001XBwpwqVD1921IEz2aLrPHA6/s728-e1000/expressvpn-india.jpg><br><br> Virtual Private Network (VPN) provider ExpressVPN on Thursday announced that it&#39;s removing Indian-based VPN servers in response to a new cybersecurity directive issued by the Indian Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-In).  &quot;Rest assured, our users will still be able to connect to VPN servers that will give them Indian IP addresses and allow them to access the internet as if they were located in India,&quot; the company&#160; said . &quot;These &#39;virtual&#39; India servers will instead be physically located in Singapore and the U.K.&quot;   The development comes as the CERT-In has enforced new&#160; controversial &#160; data retention requirements &#160;that are set to come into effect on June 27, 2022, and mandate VPN service providers to store subscribers&#39; real names, contact details, and IP addresses assigned to them for at least five years.  The logged user data, CERT-In emphasized, will only be requested for the purposes of &quot;cyber incident response, protective and preventive ....</p>
