    <h1>1. Interpol Arrest Leader of SilverTerrier Cybercrime Gang Behind BEC Attacks</h1>
    <p> <img style="border:10px solid black;" src =https://thehackernews.com/new-images/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgzN2HDysNi9PHvZ_-eVLts7yWvm0SFOGZcqsYSMf8QQuvla0gmDmu-4RpcNyWMreWXvo8rDOr6ZnJWYxqtO9UX1CSsKPO0BChUmY4Gy8fYIPTE6F-5GFE1bxYtZ3wpevxEOp6beyid0GUtvJZ81QkMpZCk0bzyet3gWPkF0z9pSVAd1ucfdlL9qUl1/s728-e1000/email.jpg id='test' onerror='error_loading_image()'><br><br> A year-long international investigation has resulted in the arrest of the suspected head of the SilverTerrier cybercrime group by the Nigeria Police Force.  &quot;The suspect is alleged to have run a transnational cybercrime syndicate that launched mass phishing campaigns and business email compromise schemes targeting companies and individual victims,&quot; Interpol&#160; said &#160;in a statement.   Operation Delilah, as the coordinated international effort is called, involved tracking the 37-year-old Nigerian man&#39;s physical movements, before he was apprehended at Murtala Mohammed International Airport in Lagos.  Singapore-headquartered cybersecurity company Group-IB said  it provided threat intelligence that led to the arrest as part of the police operation that commenced in May 2021.   The development is the third in a series of law enforcement actions aimed at the identification and arrest of the suspected members of the SilverTerrier gang (aka TMT).   In November 2020, three alleged m....</p>

    <h1>2. Lumos System Can Find Hidden Cameras and IoT Devices in Your Airbnb or Hotel Room</h1>
    <p> <img style="border:10px solid black;" src =https://thehackernews.com/new-images/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhwO4wpjpVWPkjL2NsZbnL2ZnWPJaQ_RU14QMAYq0jN-8tWms-0iOJrrPcJ0TGH7cZthof83h6APQndWZuihcibK1bCjUxJI5FWNDtiL5uBJW9B0UiGZGqWCbGj4CWTm2QsrtaJAWprlMMAGR3psb38BNQz7l-h_8EElDvOaHJIZKWohD0bdE4vQqKL/s728-e100/camera.jpg><br><br> A group of academics has devised a system that can be used on a phone or a laptop to identify and locate Wi-Fi-connected hidden IoT devices in unfamiliar physical spaces.  With hidden cameras being&#160; increasingly &#160; used &#160;to&#160; snoop &#160;on&#160; individuals &#160;in hotel rooms and Airbnbs, the goal is to be able to pinpoint such rogue devices without much of a hassle.  The system, dubbed Lumos , is designed with this intent in mind and to &quot;visualize their presence using an augmented reality interface,&quot;&#160; said &#160;Rahul Anand Sharma, Elahe Soltanaghaei, Anthony Rowe, and Vyas Sekar of Carnegie Mellon University in a new paper.   At its core, the platform works by snuffing and collecting encrypted wireless packets over the air to detect and identify concealed devices. Subsequently, it estimates the location of each identified device with respect to the user as they walk around the perimeter of the space.  The localization module, for its part, combines signal strength measurements that are avail....</p>

    <h1>3. How Secrets Lurking in Source Code Lead to Major Breaches</h1>
    <p> <img style="border:10px solid black;" src =https://thehackernews.com/new-images/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjqzS-ZZyy0Ca3T2oA8PEVFaZKhUeDXsX-E1TQCFJRFMLvJ_ikpoYTCHjss0odds_q8wzuWQvO5TKJESQe53OfGfmQ9q7ryMcCvBVHdrrg3-Uv-AvexZ6qKEWCMbwWjt1_VpltEMMJ0ndBAY0rer551IMm1vkDq5cLbcXJ6XLi29teYCJK-oBPHX3eX/s728-e1000/source-code.jpg><br><br> If one word could sum up the 2021 infosecurity year (well, actually three), it would be these: &quot;supply chain attack&quot;.&#160;  A software supply chain attack happens when hackers manipulate the code in third-party software components to compromise the &#39;downstream&#39; applications that use them. In 2021, we have seen a dramatic rise in such attacks: high profile security incidents like the SolarWinds, Kaseya, and&#160; Codecov &#160;data breaches have shaken enterprise&#39;s confidence in the security practices of third-party service providers.  What does this have to do with secrets, you might ask? In short, a lot. Take the Codecov case (we&#39;ll go back to it quickly): it is a textbook example to illustrate how hackers leverage hardcoded credentials to gain initial access into their victims&#39; systems and harvest more secrets down the chain.&#160;  Secrets-in-code remains one of the most overlooked vulnerabilities in the application security space, despite being a priority target in hack....</p>

    <h1>4. Learn How Hackers Can Hijack Your Online Accounts Even Before You Create Them</h1>
    <p> <img style="border:10px solid black;" src =https://thehackernews.com/new-images/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgvYdCUuC_3CWUY5sTqZzyY89JmeyWQIT-XI2vK1Peot-9dJxR431u4fgLpNXSWUK5sMiMpD8bInkGIry4ouWqLsxTkttv08C_ifMm1GMFICmaaSoQJv9kI_4DF2J8qu4_HOOwA_OAd2BoTeHU_Y8MNUAvZD_EK3QuFEnXM5_gCeXu0gdW8aDHKBaY4/s728-e1000/account-hacking.jpg><br><br> Malicious actors can gain unauthorized access to users&#39; online accounts via a new technique called &quot;account pre-hijacking,&quot; new research has found.  The attack takes aim at the account creation process that&#39;s ubiquitous in websites and other online platforms, enabling an adversary to perform a set of actions before an unsuspecting victim creates an account in a target service.  The study was led by independent security researcher Avinash Sudhodanan in collaboration with Andrew Paverd of the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC).  Pre-hijacking banks on the prerequisite that an attacker is already in possession of a unique identifier associated with a victim, such as an email address or phone number, which can be obtained either from the target&#39;s social media accounts or credential dumps circulating on the web.   The attacks can then play out in five different ways, including the use of the same email address during account creation by both the adversary and t....</p>

    <h1>5. Researchers Find New Malware Attacks Targeting Russian Government Entities</h1>

The cybersecurity company attributed the attacks with low confidence to a Chinese hacking group, citing infrastructure overlaps between the RAT and Sakula Rat malware used by a threat actor known as&#160; Deep Panda .  The attack chains, while leveraging different lures over the course of two months, all employed the same malware barring small differences in the source code.   The campaign is said to have commenced around February 26, days after Russia&#39;s military invasion of Ukraine, with the emails distributing the RAT under the guise of an interac....</p>

    <h1>6. [Template] Incident Response for Management Presentation</h1>
    <p> <img style="border:10px solid black;" src =https://thehackernews.com/new-images/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgvmnAuXwpdrx6EONNM_zAxfioiPy34-jP2CKVOFG8T-r1BAvBXhSGU3y7Y8UlcSpk4TIEb7zVNquGQ0oo5QDliUgBk2Pjfz-fOF96-LB07KOKvTSixp2zMyVzcB8mPOY47Z0pSt4F69p7eQ8XbZAOR0aEEu9mVFBwDsJUNf8BHDH-5OYzj3Z6R4UBE/s728-e1000/cynet.jpg><br><br> Security incidents occur. It&#39;s not a matter of &quot;if,&quot; but of &quot;when.&quot; That&#39;s why you implemented security products and procedures to optimize the incident response (IR) process.  However, many security pros who are doing an excellent job in handling incidents find effectively communicating the ongoing process with their management a much more challenging task.  Feels familiar?  In many organizations, leadership is not security savvy, and they aren&#39;t interested in the details regarding all the bits and bytes in which the security pro masters.&#160;  Luckily, there is a template that security leads can use when presenting to management. It&#39;s called the&#160; IR Reporting for Management template , providing CISOs and CIOs with a clear and intuitive tool to report both the ongoing IR process and its conclusion.  The IR Reporting for Management template enables CISOs and CIOs to communicate with the two key points that management cares about&#8212;assurance that the incid....</p>
