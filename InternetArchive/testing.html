    <h1>Iranian Hackers Leveraging BitLocker and DiskCryptor in Ransomware Attacks</h1>
    <p> <img src =https://thehackernews.com/new-images/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEit92RZjGw9jACkAjqDsOR94N2-JdMCgkGpJpKv-QVQRJS8C-Zv5ZVwPDiRNNDzpioIDIUwcCWL_acDm_Tffjk-MF63fRDGkrdRWOgrEQE0fZvicDWxjJ_nO5ZV8WJ7dSqhYXx3tkKpsY5GZMnEb9uOFAEPQi4K_hvPl4yk8JtutVxH5t_XQzGu0s8h/s728-e100/hacking-ransomware.jpg><br> A ransomware group with an Iranian operational connection has been linked to a string of file-encrypting malware attacks targeting organizations in Israel, the U.S., Europe, and Australia.  Cybersecurity firm Secureworks attributed the intrusions to a threat actor it tracks under the moniker Cobalt Mirage, which it said is linked to an Iranian hacking crew dubbed Cobalt Illusion (aka APT35, Charming Kitten, Newscaster, or Phosphorus).  &quot;Elements of Cobalt Mirage activity have been&#160; reported &#160;as&#160; Phosphorus &#160;and&#160; TunnelVision ,&quot; Secureworks Counter Threat Unit (CTU)&#160; said &#160;in a report shared with The Hacker News.   The threat actor is said to have conducted two different sets of intrusions, one of which relates to opportunistic ransomware attacks involving the use of legitimate tools like&#160; BitLocker &#160;and DiskCryptor for financial gain.  The second set of attacks are more targeted, carried out with the primary goal of securing access and gathering intelligence, while also depl</p>
    <h1>E.U. Proposes New Rules for Tech Companies to Combat Online Child Sexual Abuse</h1>
    <p> <img src =https://thehackernews.com/new-images/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEit92RZjGw9jACkAjqDsOR94N2-JdMCgkGpJpKv-QVQRJS8C-Zv5ZVwPDiRNNDzpioIDIUwcCWL_acDm_Tffjk-MF63fRDGkrdRWOgrEQE0fZvicDWxjJ_nO5ZV8WJ7dSqhYXx3tkKpsY5GZMnEb9uOFAEPQi4K_hvPl4yk8JtutVxH5t_XQzGu0s8h/s728-e100/hacking-ransomware.jpg<br> The European Commission on Wednesday proposed new regulation that would require tech companies to scan for child sexual abuse material (CSAM) and grooming behavior, raising worries that it could undermine end-to-end encryption (E2EE).  To that end, online service providers, including hosting services and communication apps, are expected to proactively scan their platforms for CSAM as well as report, remove and disable access to such illicit content.  While instant messaging services like WhatsApp&#160; already &#160; rely &#160;on hashed versions of known CSAM to automatically block new uploads of images or videos matching them, the new plan requires such platforms to identify and flag new instances of CSAM.  &quot;Detection technologies must only be used for the purpose of detecting child sexual abuse,&quot; the regulator&#160; said . &quot;Providers will have to deploy technologies that are the least privacy-intrusive in accordance with the state of the art in the industry, and that limit the error rat</p>
    <h1>Thousands of WordPress Sites Hacked to Redirect Visitors to Scam Sites</h1>
    <p> <br> Cybersecurity researchers have disclosed a massive campaign that&#39;s responsible for injecting malicious JavaScript code into compromised WordPress websites that redirects visitors to scam pages and other malicious websites to generate illegitimate traffic.  &quot;The websites all shared a common issue &#8212; malicious JavaScript had been injected within their website&#39;s files and the database, including legitimate core WordPress files,&quot; Krasimir Konov, a malware analyst at Sucuri,&#160; said &#160;in a report published Wednesday.   This involved infecting files such as jquery.min.js and jquery-migrate.min.js with obfuscated JavaScript that&#39;s activated on every page load, allowing the attacker to redirect the website visitors to a destination of their choice.  The GoDaddy-owned website security company said that the domains at the end of the redirect chain could be used to load advertisements, phishing pages, malware, or even trigger another set of redirects.   In some instances, unsus</p>
    <h1>Android and Chrome Users Can Soon Generate Virtual Credit Cards to Protect Real Ones</h1>
    <p>123<br> Google on Wednesday took to its annual developer conference to announce a host of privacy and security updates, including support for virtual credit cards on Android and Chrome.  &quot;When you use autofill to enter your payment details at checkout, virtual cards will add an additional layer of security by replacing your actual card number with a distinct, virtual number,&quot; Google&#39;s Jen Fitzpatrick&#160; said &#160;in a statement.  The goal, the search giant, said to keep payment information safe and secure during online shopping and protect users from&#160; skimming attacks &#160;wherein threat actors inject malicious JavaScript code to plunder credit card numbers and sell them on the black market.   The feature is expected to roll out in the U.S. for Visa, American Express, Mastercard, and Capital One cards starting this summer.  Interestingly, while Apple offers an option to mask email addresses via&#160; Hide My Email , which enables users to create unique, random email addresses to use with apps </p>
    <h1>Everything We Learned From the LAPSUS$ Attacks</h1>
    <p>123<br> In recent months, a cybercriminal gang known as LAPSUS$ has claimed responsibility for a number of high-profile attacks against technology companies, including:   T-Mobile (April 23, 2022)  Globant&#160;  Okta  Ubisoft  Samsung  Nvidia  Microsoft  Vodafone   In addition to these attacks, LAPSUS$ was also able to successfully launch a ransomware attack against the Brazilian Ministry of Health.  While high-profile cyber-attacks are certainly nothing new, there are several things that make LAPSUS$ unique.   The alleged mastermind of these attacks and several other alleged accomplices were all teenagers.  Unlike more traditional ransomware gangs, LAPSUS$ has a very strong social media presence.  The gang is best known for data exfiltration. It has stolen source code and other proprietary information and has often leaked this information on the Internet.   LAPSUS$ stolen credentials&#160;  In the case of Nvidia, for example, the&#160; attackers gained access to hundreds of gigabytes of proprietary data ,</p>
    <h1>Government Agencies Warn of Increase in Cyberattacks Targeting MSPs</h1>
    <p>123<br> Multiple cybersecurity authorities from Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the U.K., and the U.S. on Wednesday released a&#160; joint advisory &#160;warning of threats targeting managed service providers (MSPs) and their customers.  Key among the recommendations include identifying and disabling accounts that are no longer in use, enforcing multi-factor authentication (MFA) on MSP accounts that access customer environments, and ensuring transparency in ownership of security roles and responsibilities.  MSPs have emerged as an attractive attack route for cybercriminals to scale their attacks, as a vulnerable provider can be weaponized as an initial access vector to breach several downstream customers at once.   The spillover effects of such intrusions, as witnessed in the wake of high-profile breaches aimed at&#160; SolarWinds &#160;and&#160; Kaseya &#160;in recent years, have once again underlined the need to secure the software supply chain.  The targeting of MSPs by malicious cyber actors in an effort to &quot;expl</p>
    <h1>Hackers Deploy IceApple Exploitation Framework on Hacked MS Exchange Servers</h1>
    <p>123<br> Researchers have detailed a previously undocumented .NET-based post-exploitation framework called IceApple that has been deployed on Microsoft Exchange server instances to facilitate reconnaissance and data exfiltration.  &quot;Suspected to be the work of a state-nexus adversary, IceApple remains under active development, with 18 modules observed in use across a number of enterprise environments, as of May 2022,&quot; CrowdStrike&#160; said &#160;in a Wednesday report.   The cybersecurity firm, which discovered the sophisticated malware in late 2021, noted its presence in multiple victim networks and in geographically distinct locations. Targeted victims span a wide range of sectors, including technology, academic, and government entities.  A post-exploitation toolset, as the name implies, is not used to provide initial access, but is rather employed to carry out follow-on attacks after having already compromised the hosts in question.   IceApple is notable for the fact that it&#39;s an in-memo</p>
