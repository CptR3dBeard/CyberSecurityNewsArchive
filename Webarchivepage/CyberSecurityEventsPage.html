    <h1>1. Critical 'Pantsdown' BMC Vulnerability Affects QCT Servers Used in Data Centers</h1>
    <p> <img style="border:10px solid black;" src =https://thehackernews.com/new-images/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh5qXtbrwov4CHd0lFNhWZ_cSmFjDmKwGt7PsGSv8qbIprEUoNM4Ye2-FyPthe-sQtI1lFxIRug7xKy9nFNHOke6x_QJWylWv2q1QR-GstSeNdEfHcw2k1ayiUKy80BOHjg3cpL_MoopxaoENYD3tHPmNjFjhw8MrKQZ4YYu39k5O7zl-Hzz7udzJW1/s728-e1000/CHIP.jpg><br><br> Quanta Cloud Technology (QCT) servers have been identified as vulnerable to the severe &quot;Pantsdown&quot; Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) flaw, according to new research published today.  &quot;An attacker running code on a vulnerable QCT server would be able to &#39;hop&#39; from the server host to the BMC and move their attacks to the server management network, possibly continue and obtain further permissions to other BMCs on the network and by doing that gaining access to other servers,&quot; firmware and hardware security firm Eclypsium&#160; said .  A baseboard management controller is a specialized system used for remote monitoring and management of servers, including controlling low-level hardware settings as well as installing firmware and software updates.   Tracked as&#160; CVE-2019-6260 &#160;(CVSS score: 9.8), the&#160; critical security flaw &#160;came to light in January 2019 and relates to a case of arbitrary read and write access to the BMC&#39;s physical address space, resulting in a....</p>

    <h1>2. Experts Warn of Rise in ChromeLoader Malware Hijacking Users' Browsers</h1>
    <p> <img style="border:10px solid black;" src =https://thehackernews.com/new-images/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhC6_4iDeKNNkaYLhzMFX2rBQOux3rAcqyw6Ykg2u_dSCLUkWgMluaLg9oBZNm_29xbW3V4p8Bl-F8cKwl1Q6uwl8k76vyQqd1TmQ2lk7rQpvqx0szeRosZE-8LHSfmQ_f3SIVKR0goWCh2HRaGVtYx58o6wPywRtOeohoj1T9_4k96EMxzCUIh-WDe/s728-e1000/code.jpg><br><br> A malvertising threat is witnessing a new surge in activity since its emergence earlier this year.  Dubbed ChromeLoader , the malware is a &quot;pervasive and persistent browser hijacker that modifies its victims&#39; browser settings and redirects user traffic to advertisement websites,&quot; Aedan Russell of Red Canary&#160; said &#160;in a new report.  ChromeLoader is a rogue Chrome browser extension and is typically distributed in the form of ISO files via pay-per-install sites and baited social media posts that advertise QR codes to cracked video games and pirated movies.   While it primarily functions by hijacking user search queries to Google, Yahoo, and Bing and redirecting traffic to an advertising site, it&#39;s also notable for its use of PowerShell to inject itself into the browser and get the extension added.   The malware, also known as Choziosi Loader, was first documented by G DATA earlier this February.   &quot;For now the only purpose is getting revenue via unsolicited adverti....</p>

    <h1>3. Hackers Increasingly Using Browser Automation Frameworks for Malicious Activities</h1>
    <p> <img style="border:10px solid black;" src =https://thehackernews.com/new-images/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEilvlTnSoi9PNjSHLsY2cwLxsb8jWUmzb3Tpk4Po4wZcvTpwx_k1eUyKEG9Iv53xDsD4GeYhLcbkPG-FXc-yoBVrVfANuK4UAtDsAIrOlO-rFVePcwz4BkmX0lIi3wsLFDuk3yCKh6k4voJNp3qh5nfLYmpE5mCoAiiCjesvHFeE8fijXHePXmcHpSk/s728-e1000/hacking.jpg><br><br> Cybersecurity researchers are calling attention to a free-to-use browser automation framework that&#39;s being increasingly used by threat actors as part of their attack campaigns.  &quot;The framework contains numerous features which we assess may be utilized in the enablement of malicious activities,&quot; researchers from Team Cymru&#160; said &#160;in a new report published Wednesday.  &quot;The technical entry bar for the framework is purposefully kept low, which has served to create an active community of content developers and contributors, with actors in the underground economy advertising their time for the creation of bespoke tooling.&quot;   The U.S. cybersecurity company said it observed command-and-control (C2) IP addresses associated with malware such as&#160; Bumblebee ,&#160; BlackGuard , and&#160; RedLine Stealer &#160;establishing connections to the downloads subdomain of Bablosoft (&quot;downloads.bablosoft[.]com&quot;), the maker of the Browser Automation Studio (BAS).  Bablosoft was previously....</p>

    <h1>4. The Added Dangers Privileged Accounts Pose to Your Active Directory</h1>
    <p> <img style="border:10px solid black;" src =https://thehackernews.com/new-images/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgmmfx6hTwg1JHwOikY2zAAKvd9XNbSGswokbaw1DxdBAzW99nOuZ5vxwp4V9in3PdyMrSwuSr9wJo76T1wfeZs_TOl84cIfNnWrJ5quOUND7kPcqIywtQl8Z7aD2tzTQ5Hwt0YtAFQKE8OBWyiqViZ_92g-wuxT9QD7arO4Sj4na6ANwQw5pYl_0NC/s728-e1000/ad.jpg><br><br> In any organization, there are certain accounts that are designated as being privileged. These privileged accounts differ from standard user accounts in that they have permission to perform actions that go beyond what standard users can do. The actions vary based on the nature of the account but can include anything from setting up new user accounts to shutting down mission-critical systems.  Privileged accounts are essential tools. Without these accounts, the IT staff would be unable to do its job. At the same time, privileged accounts can pose a serious threat to an organization's security.  Added risk of a privileged account&#160;  Imagine for a moment that a hacker manages to steal a standard user's password and is able to log in as that user. Even though the hacker would have access to certain resources at that point, they would be constrained by the user's privileges (or lack thereof). In other words, the hacker would be able to browse the Internet, open some applications, and access....</p>

    <h1>5. Tails OS Users Advised Not to Use Tor Browser Until Critical Firefox Bugs are Patched</h1>
    <p> <img style="border:10px solid black;" src =https://thehackernews.com/new-images/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh5pAXGE44Uu1sVHJj3FI4VsKJXijPMdm2L0na0sV3_3TyAtpJTMtHVpR54e-kSHocCy8PIHPgxPZgaH_Tq77p4jW4vGe2QqtRq0eB8jlMYwu54pncrdeuBAepD0vZeT28cmpbqcSO5Mf9O0Z_2jFiQwQKBm4iP2q6T8shjYEjYOSCkF-awKtSHan7V/s728-e1000/tails.jpg><br><br> The maintainers of the Tails project have issued a warning that the Tor Browser that&#39;s bundled with the operating system is unsafe to use for accessing or entering sensitive information.  &quot;We recommend that you stop using Tails until the release of 5.1 (May 31) if you use Tor Browser for sensitive information (passwords, private messages, personal information, etc.),&quot; the project&#160; said &#160;in an advisory issued this week.  Tails, short for The Amnesic Incognito Live System, is a security-oriented Debian-based Linux distribution aimed at preserving privacy and anonymity by connecting to the internet through the Tor network.   The alert comes as Mozilla on May 20, 2022 rolled out fixes for&#160; two critical zero-day flaws &#160;in its Firefox browser, a modified version of which acts as the foundation of the Tor Browser.  Tracked as CVE-2022-1802 and CVE-2022-1529, the two vulnerabilities are what&#39;s referred to as&#160; prototype pollution &#160;that could be weaponized to gain JavaScript c....</p>

    <h1>6. Twitter Fined $150 Million for Misusing Users' Data for Advertising Without Consent</h1>
    <p> <img style="border:10px solid black;" src =https://thehackernews.com/new-images/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh5cFdfNRnRsPGI13zZ38oLrO1MoQBIHktZP99gq1mIdgUmiXXf-0E3PK-1S-25-vmN1pJGISKKMwEGaQVoEruCwmzD2hlfYshQ70_dzUVCywFpp_PrDMsvtNfRfzAfZitQcD6_AXhFCimvpIjplaa1ewnAyM7X8-7m78Gswxbmvkay7deRyFi18ISd/s728-e1000/twitter.jpg><br><br> Twitter, which is in the process of being acquired by Tesla CEO Elon Musk, has agreed to pay $150 million to the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to settle allegations that it abused non-public information collected for security purposes to serve targeted ads.  In addition to the monetary penalty for &quot;misrepresenting its privacy and security practices,&quot; the company has been banned from profiting from the deceptively collected data and ordered to notify all affected users.  &quot;Twitter obtained data from users on the pretext of harnessing it for security purposes but then ended up also using the data to target users with ads,&quot; FTC Chair Lina M. Khan&#160; said &#160;in a statement. &quot;This practice affected more than 140 million Twitter users, while boosting Twitter&#39;s primary source of revenue.&quot;   According to a&#160; complaint &#160;filed by the U.S. Justice Department, Twitter in May 2013 began enforcing a requirement for users to provide either a phone number or email ad....</p>
