    <h1>1. Experts Detail New RCE Vulnerability Affecting Google Chrome Dev Channel</h1>
    <p> <img style="border:10px solid black;" src =https://thehackernews.com/new-images/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgYCIITIqR1BvRI00mxTmUwuyW-21nkgyYeVX_nsGMDrrdlIjfRWP2XKoREmbamoTexo89-JeVvBa8-KkyKfCeOyQaM6xm7HPE2nGelRJGC9uYZcpAulI6At4Tp41vEzuBawyHmQWAr5q5VsfvRC-riWtk7UBG_ZwXCisj6hWfcjFm-wAsloXGhkYxp/s728-e1000/chrome.jpg><br><br> Details have emerged about a recently patched critical remote code execution vulnerability in the V8 JavaScript and WebAssembly engine used in Google Chrome and Chromium-based browsers.  The issue relates to a case of use-after-free in the instruction optimization component, successful exploitation of which could &quot;allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the browser.&quot;  The flaw, which&#160; was identified &#160;in the Dev channel version of Chrome 101, was reported to Google by Weibo Wang, a security researcher at Singapore cybersecurity company&#160; Numen Cyber Technology &#160;and has since been quietly fixed by the company.   &quot;This vulnerability occurs in the instruction selection stage, where the wrong instruction has been selected and resulting in memory access exception,&quot; Wang said .  Use-after-free flaws&#160; occur &#160;when previous-freed memory is accessed, inducing undefined behavior and causing a program to crash, use corrupted data, or even achieve execution ....</p>

    <h1>2. Nearly 100,000 NPM Users' Credentials Stolen in GitHub OAuth Breach</h1>

The archive contained NPM usernames, password hashes, and email addresses for roughly 100,000 users  A set of CSV files encompassing an archive of all names and version numbers of published versions of all NPM private packages as of April 10, 2022, and&#160;  A &quot;small subset&quot; of private packages from two orga....</p>

    <h1>3. The Myths of Ransomware Attacks and How To Mitigate Risk</h1>
    <p> <img style="border:10px solid black;" src =https://thehackernews.com/new-images/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhyboPc0fI72oced4E5rENBfNqpFFFRC1RRdn2yDqWMMUP2DRKemlO72yTpemz9Sfne6AdbiSaaFrLEBMU944ROfChvmiGT7tXuC7nWkQoCQqHj_1_LJREnGxBB7iZu8MsNRfNqbqhdvCpzka2OH8yHpRTVxHNAp59JlVfOT41Tu1PypOeP_Y8lvkPf/s728-e1000/ransomware.jpg><br><br> Today&#39;s modern companies are built on data, which now resides across countless cloud apps. Therefore&#160; preventing data loss &#160;is essential to your success. This is especially critical for mitigating against rising ransomware attacks &#8212; a threat that&#160; 57% of security leaders expect to be compromised by within the next year .&#160;  As&#160; organizations continue to evolve, in turn so does ransomware . To help you stay ahead, Lookout Chief Strategy Officer, Aaron Cockerill met with Microsoft Chief Security Advisor, Sarah Armstrong-Smith to discuss how&#160; remote work &#160;and the cloud have made it more difficult to spot a ransomware attack, as well as how deploying behavioral-anomaly-based detection can help mitigate ransomware risk.&#160; Access the full interview .&#160;  Aaron Cockerill: &#160;I feel like the way modern enterprises operate, which includes a combination of technologies, has allowed the ransomware to thrive. Having experienced this type of attack in my past roles, I know how many CISOs are feeling....</p>

    <h1>4. Attackers Can Use Electromagnetic Signals to Control Touchscreens Remotely</h1>
    <p> <img style="border:10px solid black;" src =https://thehackernews.com/new-images/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhhHpLQYlfR2eJEnwRyBmr-wj4AtVT2Am9vA5jkjV61fgGLlyPS89_fSwFR5u6Mne5sL1p_nVZY2BhPznfq_8I9PUrv-WkvbBDhJfkvxQlra3XV7AGSMW1GahXzGQaA7Hrs6DIUo7h_qsqfDtjNJHpaCOQ7sSEyhwXOL0Z9NduIc1_mnaOB30fkdPBg/s728-e1000/phone-hacking.jpg><br><br> Researchers have demonstrated what they call the &quot;first active contactless attack against capacitive touchscreens.&quot;  GhostTouch , as it&#39;s called, &quot;uses electromagnetic interference (EMI) to inject fake touch points into a touchscreen without the need to physically touch it,&quot; a group of academics from Zhejiang University and Technical University of Darmstadt&#160; said &#160;in a new research paper.  The core idea is to take advantage of the electromagnetic signals to execute basic touch events such as taps and swipes into targeted locations of the touchscreen with the goal of taking over remote control and manipulating the underlying device.   The attack, which works from a distance of up to 40mm, hinges on the fact that&#160; capacitive touchscreens &#160;are sensitive to EMI, leveraging it to inject electromagnetic signals into transparent electrodes that are built into the touchscreen so as to register them as touch events.  The experimental setup  involves an electrostatic gun....</p>

    <h1>5. Zyxel Issues Patches for 4 New Flaws Affecting AP, API Controller, and Firewall Devices</h1>

The list of security vulnerabilities is as follows -   CVE-2022-0734 &#160;- A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in some firewall versions that could be exploited to access information stored in the user&#39;s browser, such as cookies or session tokens, via a malicious script.    CVE-2022-26531 &#160;- Several input validation flaws in command line interface (CLI) commands for some versions of firewall, AP controller, and AP devices that could be exploited to cause a system crash.    CVE-2022-26532 &#160;- A command injection vulnerability in the &quot; packet-trace &quot; CLI command for some versions of firewall, AP controller, and AP devices that could lead to execution of arbitrary OS commands.

    <h1>6. Critical 'Pantsdown' BMC Vulnerability Affects QCT Servers Used in Data Centers</h1>
    <p> <img style="border:10px solid black;" src =https://thehackernews.com/new-images/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh5qXtbrwov4CHd0lFNhWZ_cSmFjDmKwGt7PsGSv8qbIprEUoNM4Ye2-FyPthe-sQtI1lFxIRug7xKy9nFNHOke6x_QJWylWv2q1QR-GstSeNdEfHcw2k1ayiUKy80BOHjg3cpL_MoopxaoENYD3tHPmNjFjhw8MrKQZ4YYu39k5O7zl-Hzz7udzJW1/s728-e1000/CHIP.jpg><br><br> Quanta Cloud Technology (QCT) servers have been identified as vulnerable to the severe &quot;Pantsdown&quot; Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) flaw, according to new research published today.  &quot;An attacker running code on a vulnerable QCT server would be able to &#39;hop&#39; from the server host to the BMC and move their attacks to the server management network, possibly continue and obtain further permissions to other BMCs on the network and by doing that gaining access to other servers,&quot; firmware and hardware security firm Eclypsium&#160; said .  A baseboard management controller is a specialized system used for remote monitoring and management of servers, including controlling low-level hardware settings as well as installing firmware and software updates.   Tracked as&#160; CVE-2019-6260 &#160;(CVSS score: 9.8), the&#160; critical security flaw &#160;came to light in January 2019 and relates to a case of arbitrary read and write access to the BMC&#39;s physical address space, resulting in a....</p>
