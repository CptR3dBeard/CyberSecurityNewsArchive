#-----Imported Functions---------------------------------------------#
#
# Below are various import statements that were used in our sample
# solution.  You should be able to complete this assignment using
# these functions only.

# Import the function for opening a web document given its URL.
from cgitb import text
from urllib.request import urlopen

# Import the function for finding all occurrences of a pattern
# defined via a regular expression, as well as the "multiline"
# and "dotall" flags.
from re import findall, MULTILINE, DOTALL

# A function for opening an HTML document in your operating
# system's default web browser. We have called the function
# "webopen" so that it isn't confused with the "open" function
# for writing/reading local text files.
from webbrowser import open as webopen

# A module with useful functions on pathnames including:
# normpath: function for 'normalising' a  path to a file to the path-naming
# conventions used on this computer.  Apply this function to the full name
# of your HTML document so that your program will work on any operating system.
# exists: returns True if the supplied path refers to an existing path
from os.path import *

# An operating system-specific function for getting the current
# working directory/folder.  Use this function to create the
# full path name to your HTML document.
from os import getcwd
 
# Import the standard Tkinter GUI functions.
from tkinter import *

# Import the date and time function.
# This module *may* be useful, depending on the websites you choose.
# Eg convert from a timestamp to a human-readable date:
# >>> datetime.fromtimestamp(1586999803) # number of seconds since 1970
# datetime.datetime(2020, 4, 16, 11, 16, 43)
from datetime import datetime

# Put your solution at the end of this file.
#
# Name of the folder containing your archived web documents.  When

# especially image files.
