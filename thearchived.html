    <h1>UpdateAgent Returns with New macOS Malware Dropper Written in Swift</h1>

UpdateAgent, first detected in late 2020, has since&#160; evolved &#160;into a malware dropper, facilitating the distribution of second-stage payloads such as adware while also bypassing macOS&#160; Gatekeeper &#160;protections.   The newly discovered Swift-based dropper masquerades as Mach-O binaries named &quot; PDFCreator &quot; and &quot; ActiveDirectory &quot; that, upon execution, establish a connection to a remote server and retrieve a bash script to be executed.   &quot;The primary difference [between the two executables] is that it reaches out to a different URL from wh</p>

Robust&#160; cloud data security &#160;is imperative for businesses adopting rapid digital transformation to the cloud. While a traditional hosting model could be considered more secure, not all organizations are receptive to relinquishing control over their infrastructure or applications by relying on a cloud provider at an increased risk of data theft from a cyberattack done by an outsider.  Having said so, let&#39;s try to understand the vital part.  What is Cloud Data Security?&#160;  Cloud data security entails securing data, whether at rest or in motion, on cloud-based infrastructure, applications, etc., against cyber threats like data breaches, unauthorized access, DDoS attacks, etc.  This includes the technologies, policies, controls, and services to protect cloud-based system</p>

Moises Luis Zagala Gonzalez, also known by the monikers Nosophoros, Aesculapius, and Nebuchadnezzar, is alleged to have both developed and marketed the ransomware to other cybercriminals to facilitate the intrusions and get a share of the bitcoin payment.  If convicted, Zagala faces up to five years&#39; imprisonment for attempted computer intrusion, and five years&#39; imprisonment for conspiracy to commit computer intrusions.&#160;   &quot;The multi-tasking doctor treated patients, created and&#160; named his cyber tool after death , profited from a global ransomware ecosystem in which he sold the tools for conducting ransomware attacks, trained the attackers about how to extort victims, and then boasted about successful attacks, including by malicious</p>

The tech giant, which has called the new version Sysrv-K , is said to weaponize an&#160; array of exploits &#160;to gain control of web servers. The cryptojacking botnet first emerged in December 2020.  &quot;Sysrv-K scans the internet to find web servers with various vulnerabilities to install itself,&quot; the company&#160; said &#160;in a series of tweets. &quot;The vulnerabilities range from path traversal and remote file disclosure to arbitrary file download and remote code execution vulnerabilities.&quot;   This also includes&#160; CVE-2022-22947 &#160;(CVSS score: 10.0), a code injection vulnerability in Spring Cloud Gateway that could be exploited to allow arbitrary remote execution on a remote host via a maliciously crafted request.  It&#39;s worth noting that the abuse of CVE-2022-22947 has prompted the U.S. Cyb</p>

While this is done so as to enable features like&#160; Find My &#160;and facilitate&#160; Express Card transactions , all the three wireless chips have direct access to the secure element, academics from the Secure Mobile Networking Lab ( SEEMOO ) at the Technical University of Darmstadt&#160; said &#160;in a paper entitled &quot;Evil Never Sleeps.&quot;   &quot;The Bluetooth and UWB chips are hardwired to the Secure Element (SE) in the NFC chip, storing secrets that should be available in LPM,&quot; the researchers sa</p>
