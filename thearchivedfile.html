    <h1>SonicWall Releases Patches for New Flaws Affecting SSLVPN SMA1000 Devices</h1>
    <p> <img src =https://thehackernews.com/new-images/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgTdzwEIazKL1IdHuI1NcNGE2sZchTrb7XxlrDd5DHL-FHWh4qvHuJPHjY24fmTtAyows70s53kU4bwyR5o3h8i8h4hk6Nf5aPJ2F5iLW9yC5HJgkM26KmzaOep81nAwD8aLesFS81sXffSMhhr9Tn4acdENs5n7Ezf-IlQINE7pQIWiYIcB6VH9Ec5/s728-e1000/sonicwall.jpg><br><br> SonicWall has published an&#160; advisory &#160;warning of a trio of security flaws in its Secure Mobile Access (SMA) 1000 appliances, including a high-severity authentication bypass vulnerability.  The weaknesses in question impact SMA 6200, 6210, 7200, 7210, 8000v running firmware versions 12.4.0 and 12.4.1. The list of vulnerabilities is below -   CVE-2022-22282 &#160;(CVSS score: 8.2) - Unauthenticated Access Control Bypass  CVE-2022-1702 &#160;(CVSS score: 6.1) - URL redirection to an untrusted site (open redirection)  CVE-2022-1701 &#160;(CVSS score: 5.7) - Use of a shared and hard-coded cryptographic key   Successful exploitation of the aforementioned bugs could allow an attacker to unauthorized access to internal resources and even redirect potential victims to malicious websites.   Tom Wyatt of the Mimecast Offensive Security Team has been credited with discovering and reporting the vulnerabilities.  SonicWall noted that the flaws do not affect SMA 1000 series running versions earlier than 12.4.0, SM</p>

    <h1>Google Created 'Open Source Maintenance Crew' to Help Secure Critical Projects</h1>

Additionally, the tech giant pointed out&#160; Open Source Insights &#160;as a tool for analyzing packages and their dependency graphs, using it to determine &quot;whether a vulnerability in a dependency might affect your code.&quot;  &quot;With this information, developers can understand how their software is put together and the consequences to changes in their dependencies,&quot; the company said.  The development comes as security and trust in the open source software ecosystem has been increasingly thrown into question in the aftermath of a&#160; string &#160;of&#160; supply chain &#160; attacks &#160;designed to compromise developer workflows.   In December 2021, a critical flaw in the ubiquitous open source&#160; Log4j logging library &#160;left several companies scrambling to patch their systems against potential abuse.

    <h1>New Saitama backdoor Targeted Official from Jordan's Foreign Ministry</h1>

Researchers from Malwarebytes and Fortinet FortiGuard Labs&#160; attributed &#160;the campaign to an Iranian cyber espionage threat actor tracked under the moniker APT34, citing&#160; resemblances &#160;to past campaigns staged by the group.  &quot;Like many of these attacks, the email contained a malicious attachment,&quot; Fortinet researcher Fred Gutierrez&#160; said . &quot;However, the attached threat was not a garden-variety malware. Instead, it had the capabilities and techniques usually associated with advanced persistent threats (APTs).&quot;   APT34, also known as OilRig, Helix Kitten, and Cobalt Gypsy, is known to be active since at least 2014 and has a track record of striking telecom, government, defense, oil, and financial sectors in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) via targeted phishing attacks.  Earlier this February, ESET&#160; tied &#160;the group to a long-runni</p>

    <h1>Zyxel Releases Patch for Critical Firewall OS Command Injection Vulnerability</h1>

Cybersecurity firm Rapid7, which&#160; discovered &#160;and reported the flaw on April 13, 2022, said that the weakness could permit a remote unauthenticated adversary to execute code as the &quot;nobody&quot; user on impacted appliances.   Tracked as&#160; CVE-2022-30525 &#160;(CVSS score: 9.8), the flaw impacts the following products, with patches released in version ZLD V5.30 -   USG FLEX 100(W), 200, 500, 700  USG FLEX 50(W) / USG20(W)-VPN  ATP series, and&#160;  VPN series   Rapid 7 noted that there are at least 16,213 vulnerable Zyxel devices exposed to the internet, making it a</p>

    <h1>Iranian Hackers Leveraging BitLocker and DiskCryptor in Ransomware Attacks</h1>

Cybersecurity firm Secureworks attributed the intrusions to a threat actor it tracks under the moniker Cobalt Mirage, which it said is linked to an Iranian hacking crew dubbed Cobalt Illusion (aka APT35, Charming Kitten, Newscaster, or Phosphorus).  &quot;Elements of Cobalt Mirage activity have been&#160; reported &#160;as&#160; Phosphorus &#160;and&#160; TunnelVision ,&quot; Secureworks Counter Threat Unit (CTU)&#160; said &#160;in a report shared with The Hacker News.   The threat actor is said to have conducted two different sets of intrusions, one of which relates to opportunistic ransomware attacks involving the use of legitimate tools like&#160; BitLocker &#160;and DiskCryptor for financial gain.  The second set of attacks are more targeted, carried out with the primary goal of securing access and gathering intelligence, while also depl</p>

    <h1>E.U. Proposes New Rules for Tech Companies to Combat Online Child Sexual Abuse</h1>
    <p><img src =https://thehackernews.com/new-images/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEinRsu3JCutblBo2HS9MoaD1qfotSYUgHUff2hBFRVVoSrQRLQMPX4SbIMYwZOhWC1dAFSQ-BHxVi_fftV4GFQv9yJKN3YJRQ4Cv3ZjhjdvMz27rtnnpamof262LijkgMLyNMJnZqUcgowTQidMqW1IVSpEEG2VxJHV5IU7sb0_2R3pBGds1dezeAcP/s728-e1000/child.jpg><br><br> The European Commission on Wednesday proposed new regulation that would require tech companies to scan for child sexual abuse material (CSAM) and grooming behavior, raising worries that it could undermine end-to-end encryption (E2EE).  To that end, online service providers, including hosting services and communication apps, are expected to proactively scan their platforms for CSAM as well as report, remove and disable access to such illicit content.  While instant messaging services like WhatsApp&#160; already &#160; rely &#160;on hashed versions of known CSAM to automatically block new uploads of images or videos matching them, the new plan requires such platforms to identify and flag new instances of CSAM.  &quot;Detection technologies must only be used for the purpose of detecting child sexual abuse,&quot; the regulator&#160; said . &quot;Providers will have to deploy technologies that are the least privacy-intrusive in accordance with the state of the art in the industry, and that limit the error rat</p>
