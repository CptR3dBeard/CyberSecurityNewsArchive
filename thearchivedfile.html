    <h1>How to Protect Your Data When Ransomware Strikes</h1>
    <p> <img src =https://thehackernews.com/new-images/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgOxf9mu7Q0tCGzDBc5bGgQ9be0lDb9mN49mUNkAsy25cTLQB5RyIW--fOLm1RhXWNa-dyxFzsxiN6Gu6uHIO0IINRLhgoF7HJI1XL0tZolxMo-WAeKFVk3ffMduibuoUXEVM3t_lZ6lLTbI9CeI22ZBA5WsXME3IEUaPvIx5XbZsfyk7_r_ZJot7NW/s728-e1000/ransomware.jpg><br><br> Ransomware &#160;is not a new attack vector. In fact, the&#160; first malware of its kind &#160;appeared more than 30 years ago and was distributed via 5.25-inch floppy disks. To pay the ransom, the victim had to mail money to a P.O. Box in Panama.  Fast forward to today, affordable ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) kits are available on the dark web for anyone to purchase and deploy and attackers have an infinite number of channels available to them to infiltrate organizations as a result of reliance on cloud and mobile technologies.  Initiating a ransomware attack is all about discretely gaining access. And as employees can now access your data from anywhere, you have lost visibility into how they do so. To safeguard against these attacks, you&#39;re not just looking for malware, you need continuous insights into your users, the endpoints they use and the applications and data they access.  Lookout , a leader in endpoint-to-cloud security, has published an interactive infographic to help you visualiz</p>

    <h1>Researchers Expose Inner Workings of Billion-Dollar Wizard Spider Cybercrime Gang</h1>

That&#39;s not all. The TrickBot operators have also extensively cooperated with&#160; Conti , another Russia-linked cybercrime group notorious for offering ransomware-a</p>

    <h1>Hackers Gain Fileless Persistence on Targeted SQL Servers Using a Built-in Utility</h1>

The intrusions, which leverage brute-force attacks as an initial compromise vector, stand out for their use of the utility &quot; sqlps.exe ,&quot; the tech giant&#160; said &#160;in a series of tweets.  The ultimate goals of the campaign are unknown, as is the identity of the threat actor staging it. Microsoft is tracking the malware under the name &quot; SuspSQLUsage .&quot;   The sqlps.exe utility, which comes by default with all versions of SQL Servers, enables an SQL Agent &#8212; a Windows service to run scheduled tasks &#8212; to run jobs using the PowerShell subsystem.  &quot;The attackers achieve fileless persistence by spawning the sqlps.exe utility, a PowerShell wrapper for running SQL-built cmdlets, to run recon commands and change the start mode of the SQL service to LocalSystem,&quot; Microsoft noted.

    <h1>[eBook] Your 90-Day MSSP Plan: How to Improve Margins and Scale-Up Service Delivery</h1>

The good news is that demand is through the roof. 69% of organizations plan to boost spending on cybersecurity in 2022.&#160;  The bad news is that everyone wants a piece of the pie. MSSPs must outshine each other while fending off encroachments by traditional IT vendors and MSPs. As a result, some MSSPs are succumbing to the squeeze of low margins. Others are struggling to scale successfully.&#160;  The most successful MSSPs are taking action to improve their current financial position while laying a foundation for long-term growth. A new eBook, &quot; Your 90-Day MSSP Plan: How to Improve Margins and Scale Up Service Delivery ,&quot; to help MSSPs understand the current cybersecurity landscape, their current position in it, what you they&#39;re well, and where they can improve the most.&#160;  This nine-step plan offers a clear path for MSSPs to boost profitab</p>

    <h1>U.S. Warns Against North Korean Hackers Posing as IT Freelancers</h1>

That&#39;s according to a&#160; joint advisory &#160;from the U.S. Department of State, the Department of the Treasury, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) issued on Monday.  Targets include financial, health, social media, sports, entertainment, and lifestyle-focused companies located in North America, Europe, and East Asia, with most of the dispatched workers situated in China, Russia, Africa, and Southeast Asia.  The goal, the U.S. agencies warn, is to generate a constant stream of revenue that sidesteps international sanctions imposed on the nation and help serve its economic and security priorities, including the development of nuclear and ballistic missiles.   &quot;The North Korean government withholds up to 90 perce</p>

    <h1>Russian Conti Ransomware Gang Threatens to Overthrow New Costa Rican Government</h1>

The tech giant dubbed the new threat &quot;cryware,&quot; with the attacks resulting in the irreversible theft of virtual currencies by means of fraudulent transfers to an adversary-controlled wallet.  &quot;Cryware are information stealers that collect and exfiltrate data directly from non-custodial cryptocurrency wallets, also known as&#160; hot wallets ,&quot; Berman Enconado and Laurie Kirk of the Microsoft 365 Defender Research Team&#160; said &#160;in a new report.&#160;  &quot;Because hot wallets, unlike custodial wallets, are stored locally on a device and provide easier access to cryptographic keys needed to perform transactions, more and more threats are targeting them.&quot;   Attacks of this kind are not theoretical. Earlier this year, Kaspersky&#160; disclosed &#160;a financially-motivated campaign staged by the North Korea-based Lazarus Gr</p>
