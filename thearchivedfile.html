    <h1>Researchers Find Potential Way to Run Malware on iPhone Even When it's OFF</h1>

While this is done so as to enable features like&#160; Find My &#160;and facilitate&#160; Express Card transactions , all the three wireless chips have direct access to the secure element, academics from the Secure Mobile Networking Lab ( SEEMOO ) at the Technical University of Darmstadt&#160; said &#160;in a paper.   &quot;The Bluetooth and UWB chips are hardwired to the Secure Element (SE) in the NFC chip, storing secrets that should be available in LPM,&quot; the researchers said.  &quot;Since LPM support is impleme....</p>

    <h1>Fake Clickjacking Bug Bounty Reports: The Key Facts</h1>

If not, you should be. This article will get you up to speed and help you to stay alert.  What are clickjacking bug bounty reports?  If we start by breaking up the term into its component parts, a bug bounty is a program offered by an organization, in which individuals are rewarded for finding and reporting software bugs. These programs are often used by companies as a cost-effective way to find and fix software vulnerabilities, thereby improving the security of their products. They also help to build goodwill with the security community.&#160;  For the bounty hunters (or white hat hackers), they have an opportunity to earn money and recognition for their skills.&#160;  Clickjacking is a malicious technique used to trick users into clicking on something that they think is safe, but is actually harmful. For example, a hacker could create a fake button that looks like the &quot;like&quot; button on a social media site. When users click on it,....</p>

    <h1>Europe Agrees to Adopt New NIS2 Directive Aimed at Hardening Cybersecurity</h1>

What makes this malware-as-a-service (MaaS) stand out is that besides using a Telegram channel to communicate updates about the latest features, it also employs a&#160; Telegram Bot &#160;that enables the purchasers to build the binary.   &quot;The [threat actors] provide an option in the Telegram channel to customize the binary features, which provides an effective way to build binaries without any dependencies,&quot; researchers from Cyble&#160; said &#160;in a report published last week.   Each of the modules can be leased separately and provides paid access to a wide variety of functions -   Eternity Stealer &#160;($260 for an annual subscription) - Siphon passwords, cookies, credit cards, browser cryptocurrency extensions, crypt....</p>

The revised directive, called &quot; NIS2 &quot; (short for network and information systems), is expected to replace the&#160; existing legislation &#160;on cybersecurity that was established in July 2016.  The revamp sets ground rules, requiring companies in energy, transport, financial markets, health, and digital infrastructure sectors to adhere to risk management measures and reporting obligations.  Among the provisions in the new legislation are flagging cybersecurity incidents to authorities within 24 hours, patching software vulnerabilities, and readying risk management measures to secure networks, failing which can incur monetary penalties.   &quot;The directive will formally establish the European Cyber Crises Liaison Organization Network, EU-CyCLONe, which will support the coordinated management of larg....</p>

Glib Oleksandr Ivanov-Tolpintsev , who pleaded guilty to his offenses earlier this February, was arrested in Poland in October 2020, before being&#160; extradited to the U.S. &#160;in September 2021.  The illegal sale involved the trafficking of login credentials to servers located across the world and personally identifiable information such as dates of birth and Social Security numbers belonging to U.S. residents on a darknet marketplace.   The unnamed site purportedly offered over 700,000 compromised servers for sale, including at least 150,000 in the U.S. alone. Believed to have been operational from around October 2014, the underground marketplace was seized by law enforcement authorities on January 24, 2019, according to court documents.  This exactly coincides with the dism....</p>
