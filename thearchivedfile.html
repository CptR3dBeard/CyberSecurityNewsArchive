    <h1>Popular PyPI Package 'ctx' and PHP Library 'phpass' Hijacked to Steal AWS Keys</h1>
    <p> <img src =https://thehackernews.com/new-images/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjHJ4wNORgVjUdAixTZAPzpqjXgb9ifMK6BzTTFNB24L6pThD9AaNdliGplGLVOTNP4aK1F2oP75o5tTTthPCgZrLEQ9LfukDW4ZQAlkmqG49DCXeJhEdO6vh8D2t7cI19Tobuoh_xVbDPiuqIeKImLCfSCo-xaaSnoX37hR8E3CDye5TEAkgXfWAxc/s728-e1000/python-php.jpg><br><br> Two trojanized Python and PHP packages have been uncovered in what&#39;s yet another instance of a software supply chain attack targeting the open source ecosystem.  One of the packages in question is &quot;ctx,&quot; a Python module available in the PyPi repository. The other involves &quot;phpass,&quot; a PHP package that&#39;s been forked on GitHub to distribute a rogue update.  &quot;In both cases the attacker appears to have taken over packages that have not been updated in a while,&quot; the SANS Internet Storm Center (ISC)&#160; said , one of whose volunteer incident handlers, Yee Ching, analyzed the ctx package.  It&#39;s worth noting that ctx was last published to PyPi on December 19, 2014. On the other hand, phpass hasn&#39;t received an update since it was uploaded to Packagist on August 31, 2012.  The malicious Python package, which was pushed to PyPi on May 21, 2022, has been&#160; removed from the repository , but the PHP library still continues to be&#160; available &#160;on GitHub.

    <h1>SIM-based Authentication Aims to Transform Device Binding Security to End Phishing</h1>

Passwords create inherent vulnerability in the system. The success rate of phishing attacks is&#160; skyrocketing , and opportunities for the attack have greatly multiplied as lives moved online. All it takes is one password to be compromised for all other users to become victims of a data breach.&#160;  To deliver additional security, therefore, digital identities rely on verification plasters. MFA (multi-factor authentication) often falls back to knowledge factors such as password resets and OTP codes, but these are still vulnerable. As long as credentials can be shared or intercepted, they can be misused.&#160;  What is needed is a paradigm shift &#8211; from knowledge-based credentials to strong possession-factor security that can&#39;t be compromised, alongside other verification security such as biometrics.  A new possession-factor API now aims to do precisely that, replacing knowledge-based credentials, by using the SIM card for possess....</p>

    <h1>Malware Analysis: Trickbot</h1>

Chaos is a customizable ransomware builder that&#160; emerged &#160;in underground forums on June 9, 2021, by falsely marketing itself as the .NET version of Ryuk despite sharing no such overlaps with the notorious counterpart.  The fact that it&#39;s offered for sale also means that any malicious actor can purchase the builder and develop their own ransomware strains, turning it into a potent threat.  It has since undergone five successive iterations aimed at improving its functionalities: version 2.0 on June 17, version 3.0 on July 5, version 4.0 on August 5, and version 5.0 in early 2022.   While the first three variants of Chaos functioned more l....</p>

    <h1>Conti Ransomware Operation Shut Down After Splitting into Smaller Groups</h1>

Malware is an industry, and professional developers are found to exchange, be it by stealing one&#39;s code or deliberate collaboration. Attacks are multi-layer these days, with diverse sophisticated software apps taking over different jobs along the attack-chain from initial compromise to ultimate data exfiltration or encryption. The specific tools for each stage are highly specialized and can often be rented as a service, including customer support and subscription models for professional (ab)use. Obviously, this has largely increased both the availability and the potential effectiveness and impact of malware. Sound scary?&#160;  Well, it does, but the apparent professionalization actually does have some good sides too. One factor is that certain reused modules commonly found in malware can be used to identify, track, and analyze professional attack software. Ultimately this means that....</p>

    <h1>Microsoft Warns of Web Skimmers Mimicking Google Analytics and Meta Pixel Code</h1>

AdvIntel said Conti, which is also tracked under the moniker&#160; Gold Ulrick , orchestrated its own demise by utilizing information warfare techniques.   The disb....</p>

    <h1>Yes, Containers Are Terrific, But Watch the Security Risks</h1>
    <p><img src =https://thehackernews.com/new-images/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjNd-pqNN4DFUf--Swf4LAMnD6twXwDv8hXCMKjWVgXRmGIz3FdG7ByKuRbp7FU06EGE2Uom3kib1PfeVzRIq_un1yxyrDYFo57VP9djCi5pRhrcL1NCkVd3QfvNjfxgKZw-Foh5rVf_lk-6Nn54f4GExOX5FU2j8XHjK_htOvdLvh1nBtKmt5d5azN/s728-e1000/linux.jpg><br><br> Threat actors behind web skimming campaigns are leveraging malicious JavaScript code that mimics Google Analytics and Meta Pixel scripts in an attempt to sidestep detection.  &quot;It&#39;s a shift from earlier tactics where attackers conspicuously injected malicious scripts into e-commerce platforms and content management systems (CMSs) via vulnerability exploitation, making this threat highly evasive to traditional security solutions,&quot; Microsoft 365 Defender Research Team&#160; said &#160;in a new report.  Skimming attacks, such as those by Magecart, are carried out with the goal of harvesting and exporting users&#39; payment information, such as credit card details, entered into online payment forms in e-commerce platforms, typically during the checkout process.   This is achieved by taking advantage of security vulnerabilities in third-party plugins and other tools to inject rogue JavaScript code into the online portals without the owners&#39; knowledge.  As skimming attacks have incre....</p>
