    <h1>New Bluetooth Hack Could Let Attackers Remotely Unlock Smart Locks and Cars</h1>
    <p> <img src =https://thehackernews.com/new-images/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjYZHATZ75Edo6w5xQ7hJewrBG2rV7aBBz4nmoMpZzPf2Gm_uhPnAWjw7nZZ2qiF9GneL1G0yuLSY764kraAO18vZ1Kd_xbZmBL-PA8VRIpAWtvtyRtcbWdcaNrZRLAMwgkgrlKku9nAOc9fZEqkSaFSckcKxvjs-s3Kve4aUOr_-qaINML7I1lb8RR/s728-e100/bluetooth-hacking-flaws.jpg><br>['20may2022']<br> A novel Bluetooth relay attack can let cybercriminals more easily than ever remotely&#160; unlock and operate cars ,&#160; break open residential smart locks , and breach secure areas.  The vulnerability has to do with weaknesses in the current implementation of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), a wireless technology used for authenticating Bluetooth devices that are physically located within a close range.   &quot;An attacker can falsely indicate the proximity of Bluetooth LE (BLE) devices to one another through the use of a relay attack,&quot; U.K.-based cybersecurity company NCC Group&#160; said . &quot;This may enable unauthorized access to devices in BLE-based proximity authentication systems.&quot;  Relay attacks , also called two-thief attacks, are a variation of person-in-the-middle attacks in which an adversary intercepts communication between two parties, one of whom is also an attacker, and then relays it to the target device without any manipulation.  While various mitigations have been implem</p>

    <h1>7 Key Findings from the 2022 SaaS Security Survey Report</h1>

The report gathers anonymous responses from 340 CSA members to examine not only the growing risks in SaaS security but also how different organizations are currently working to secure themselves.  Demographics  The majority (71%) of respondents were located in the Americas, another 17% from Asia, and 13% from EMEA. Of these participants 49% influence the decision-making process while 39% run the process itself. The survey examined organizations from a variety of industries, such as telecommunications (25%), finance (22%), and government (9%).&#160;  While there are many takeaways from the survey, these are our top seven.&#160;  1: SaaS Misconfigurations are Leading to Security Incidents  Since 2019, SaaS misconfigurations have become a top concern for organizations, with at least 43% of organizations reporting </p>

    <h1>High-Severity Bug Reported in Google's OAuth Client Library for Java</h1>

Tracked as&#160; CVE-2021-22573 , the vulnerability is rated 8.7 out of 10 for severity and relates to an authentication bypass in the library that stems from an improper verification of the cryptographic signature.  Credited with discovering and reporting the flaw on March 12 is&#160; Tamjid Al Rahat , a fourth-year Ph.D. student of Computer Science at the University of Virginia, who has been awarded $5,000 as part of Google&#39;s bug bounty program.   &quot;The vulnerability is that the IDToken verifier does not verify if the token is properly signed,&quot; an&#160; advisory &#160;for the flaw reads.  &quot;Signature verification makes sure that the token&#39;s payload comes from a valid provider, not from someone else. An attacker can provide a compromised token with custom payload. The token will pass the validation on </p>

The study&#160; involved &#160;crawling 2.8 million pages from the top 100 websites, and found that as many as 1,844 websites allowed trackers to capture email addresses before form submission in the European Union, a number that jumped to 2,950 when the same set of websites were visited from the U.S.  &quot;Emails (or their hashes) were sent to 174 distinct domains ( eTLD+1 ) in the U.S. crawl, and 157 distinct domains in the EU crawl,&quot; the researchers&#160; said . Furthermore, 52 websites were determined to be collecting passwords in the same manner, an issue that has since been addressed following responsible disclosure.   LiveRamp, Taboola, Adobe, Verizon, Yandex, Meta Platforms, TikTok, Salesforce, Listrak, and Oracle accounted f</p>

    <h1>VMware Releases Patches for New Vulnerabilities Affecting Multiple Products</h1>

The first of the two flaws, tracked as CVE-2022-22972 (CVSS score: 9.8), concerns an authentication bypass that could enable an actor with network access to the UI to gain administrative access without prior authentication.  CVE-2022-22973 (CVSS score: 7.8), the other bug, is a case of local privilege escalation that could enable an attacker with local access to elevate privileges to the &quot;root&quot; user on vulnerable virtual appliances.  &quot;It is extremely important that you quickly take steps to patch or mitigate these issues in on-premises deployments,&quot; VMware&#160; said .   The disclosure follows a&#160; warning &#160;from the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Agency (CISA) that advanced persistent threat (APT) groups are exploiting CVE-2022-22954 and CVE-2022-22960 &#8212; two other VMware flaws t</p>

In fact, the&#160; first malware of its kind &#160;appeared more than 30 years ago and was distributed via 5.25-inch floppy disks. To pay the ransom, the victim had to mail money to a P.O. Box in Panama.  Fast forward to today, affordable ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) kits are available on the dark web for anyone to purchase and deploy and attackers have an infinite number of channels available to them to infiltrate organizations as a result of reliance on cloud and mobile technologies.  Initiating a ransomware attack is all about discretely gaining access. And as employees can now access your data from anywhere, you have lost visibility into how they do so. To safeguard against these attacks, you&#39;re not just looking for malware, you need continuous insights into your users, the endpoints they use and the applications and data they access.  Lookout , a leader in endpoint-to-cloud security, has published an interactive infographic to help you visualiz</p>

That&#39;s not all. The TrickBot operators have also extensively cooperated with&#160; Conti , another Russia-linked cybercrime group notorious for offering ransomware-a</p>
